		File Pirate file picker by Nicholas FitzRoy-Dale~

File Pirate is a quick file picker for Vim. When you summon it, it pops up a
Vim window and displays all files which match the search term you type. The
search is performed in such a way that the file need not contain all the
characters you type contiguously, but they must appear in the same order in
the file name as they do in your search term.

More information is available at File Pirate's Github repository:

File Pirate uses Pathogen to install. Pathogen is available at
https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen .

Once Pathogen is installed, you can install File Pirate using the following
commands:

	$ cd ~/.vim/bundle
	$ git clone https://github.com/nfd/filepirate.git
	$ cd filepirate/plugin
	$ make

Back in Vim, run :Helptags to get Vim to notice the new documentation.

==============================================================================
1. Usage						*filepirate-usage*

Press <Leader>-T to bring up the File Pirate window. Typically the Vim leader
is a backslash, so this would be \t. Start typing a filename, and files will
appear below the search term you type. To select a file, move the cursor using
the up and down arrows, and press enter to load the file. When the window
opens, the cursor is already positioned on the first result, so if the first
match is the one you want you can just hit enter.

File Pirate doesn't rescan the directory contents each time it is opened,
which is a problem if you add or remove files. To get it to rescan, press
<CTRL-R>.

If you decide you don't actually want to load a file, press <ESC><ESC> to
close the File Pirate window.

That's about it, really.

==============================================================================
2. Options						*filepirate-options*

By default, File Pirate uses <Leader>-T to open the file picker, and <CTRL-R>
to rescan. You can customise both of these.

To customise the open command, first disable File Pirate's default behaviour
in your .vimrc:

	let g:filepirate_map_leader=0

Then map whatever you like to invoke "python filepirate_open()". For example,
to map <Ctrl>-T to File Pirate, use:

	nmap <C-t> :python filepirate_open()<CR>

To customise the rescan command, assign the sequence you want to the global
variable filepirate_rescan. For example, to use F5 to rescan:

	let g:filepirate_rescan="<F5>"

You can use the same technique to change the following additional key
bindings, if you like:

g:filepirate_up: move cursor up (default: <Up>).
g:filepirate_down: move cursor down (default: <Down>).
g:filepirate_bs: delete the most-recently-typed character (default: <BS>).
g:filepirate_accept: close File Pirate, and open the file under the cursor (default: <CR>).
g:filepirate_cancel: close File Pirate (default: <Esc>).
