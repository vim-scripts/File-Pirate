File Pirate is a fuzzy file picker plug-in for Vim, in the tradition of Textmate GoToFile and the Cmd-T plug-in. Its key differentiating feature is that it is very fast, even for large repositories (expect real-time response for a directory of 50 000 files).

It requires Vim with Python support, the ability to compile native code, and a Mac or Linux system. Windows support is planned.

All key mappings are easily customisable.
